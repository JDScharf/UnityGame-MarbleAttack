# UnityGame-MarbleAttack
Can be played at: https://connect.unity.com/p/marble-attack
Created with the Create with Code Course, control your marble with the W,A,S,D controllers or the arrows to hit the power ups and dodge the enemy marbles.  Epic sounding right?  Left and Right (or A and D) spin the camera angle around.  I did not design this game, but wrote the scripting programming using prefab objects made by Synty Studios.
